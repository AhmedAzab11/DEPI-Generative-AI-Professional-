# ‚¶Å Project Idea  
This project aims to build a Personalized Chatbot with Dynamic Responses using fine-tuning techniques on Hugging Face datasets. Specifically, it is a Multilingual Medical Assistant with LoRA-Optimized FastLanguageModel (Gemma-7B PEFT). The chatbot leverages efficient inference techniques like 4-bit quantization for performance optimization and RoPE scaling to handle extended conversations.

## ‚¶Å	Brief Description of the Problem Being Solved:
In the medical field, patients, healthcare providers, and professionals frequently encounter complex medical terminology and abbreviations that are not easily understood without specific expertise. Moreover, accessing accurate and up-to-date medical information across different languages can be challenging, especially in multilingual environments. This can lead to misunderstandings, incorrect diagnoses, or a delay in obtaining proper medical advice. The issue is further compounded by the lack of user-friendly platforms capable of providing real-time, accurate medical information in a way that is accessible to both professionals and the public.
